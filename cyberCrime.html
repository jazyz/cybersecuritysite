          <b>The Issue:</b><br /><br />
          Cybercriminals are all over the internet, waiting for some
          unsuspecting internet user to fall into their trap. Once you fall in,
          these criminals will steal your data and invade your privacy. Here are
          some ways they do that: <br /><br />
          <b>1. Phishing</b><br /><br />Cybercriminals use techniques like
          phishing in order to gain access to your data. They pretend to be a
          trusted entity, and then they try to get you to click on emails, text
          messages, or links. Once they trick you, they can then steal your
          data, such as your bank accounts, email addresses, and more. They
          might even try to impersonate you! This is called identity theft,
          which has becoming increasingly common as new technologies develop.<br /><br /><b
            >2. Malware</b
          ><br /><br />Malware is another dangerous way for your private
          information to be stolen. If you are not careful, you could end up
          with malware or viruses on your computer, which are malicious
          softwares that can range from annoying pop-ups to covert bitcoin
          mining to scanning for personal information. These can make your life
          a living nightmare. You definitely don’t want this to happen to
          you.<br /><br /><br />
          <b>The Solutions:</b><br /><br />
          There are many measures that you can take to safeguard yourself
          against cyber crimes. Here are some ways to do so.<br /><br />
          <b>1. Be Vigilant</b><br /><br />Always be skeptical. Don’t click on
          suspicious things and don’t visit sketchy websites. Be wary of common
          scams and things that sound too good to be true. Also, you can check
          if your email address has been breached by using a site called Have I
          Been Pwned? If you have been affected, use the strategy below.
          <br /><br />
          <b>2. Strong Passwords / Password Manager</b><br /><br />One thing
          that you should be doing is using strong passwords for all your
          accounts, which will make it difficult for hackers to gain access.
          This usually involves the use of special characters and numbers, and
          it is also a good idea to use a different password for each account,
          in case one of them gets compromised. To help with this process, there
          are password managers out there which can generate passwords, monitor
          accounts for security breaches, suggest changing weak passwords, and
          sync your passwords between your computer and phone.<br /><br />
          <b>3. Anti-Virus</b><br /><br />To protect yourself from viruses, you
          can use anti-virus softwares such as McAfee or Norton, which will scan
          your computer for viruses and deal with them for you. If you are on
          Mac, the built-in defense is usually good enough for most users.
