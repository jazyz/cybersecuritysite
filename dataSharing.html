          <b>The Issue:</b><br /><br />
          We share tons of data with all sorts of companies all the time,
          whether we know it or not. Unfortunately, our data might be misused or
          even stolen. Here are some ways that can happen.<br /><br />
          <b>1. Apps</b><br /><br />Many of the apps you use on a regular basis
          may request info such as location details, phone numbers, and email
          addresses, but some may ask for more. This could include your phone
          camera, microphone, or contacts. If you were to allow access to all of
          the information on your device, it may result in your data being
          shared without your knowledge. <br /><br /><b>2. Social Media</b
          ><br /><br />Any information posted on social media may also be at
          risk if you are not careful. For instance, one example of a privacy
          scandal was the Cambridge Analytica story, in which data was used to
          manipulate voters, conduct cyberbullying, and dox other users. Many
          huge platforms have suffered data breaches, such as Facebook, where a
          massive data breach leaked the personal data of 533 million users,
          which included full names, phone numbers, locations, birth dates,
          bios, and email addresses. <br /><br /><br />
          <b>The Solutions:</b><br /><br />
          To prevent data from being misused or stolen, it is important to make
          sure that you only share personal information when absolutely
          necessary. Here are some ways to do so.<br /><br />
          <b>1. Limit Access</b><br /><br />It is important to limit the access
          that certain apps have on info such as location, photos, or contacts.
          You should always consider if the app provider that is requesting this
          access is trustworthy, and make sure to read the terms and conditions
          so that you know what will be done with it. If you are worried, you
          can always deny access later in the app settings.<br /><br />
          <b>2. Share As Little As Possible</b><br /><br />On social media, it
          might be tempting to post a lot of information about yourself because
          all your friends are doing so too. However, posting things such as
          your home address, phone number, and email address is unnecessary, and
          can lead to your data being leaked.<br /><br />
