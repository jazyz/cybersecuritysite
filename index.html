          <p class="paragraph">
            Privacy in the physical world is closing your bedroom curtains when
            getting ready for bed, or locking your doors at night. This seems
            like second nature to us, but in the digital space the idea of
            privacy is skewed. We should have just as much privacy online as we
            have in real life. We should be able to use the internet without
            constant fear of being tracked.

          <p class="paragraph">
            As our lives become more integrated with technology, the concern
            about our online personal privacy is rising. Our data is being
            collected unknowingly or without our consent. This is because our
            personal data is extremely valuable on the internet. It is
            collected, analyzed, and sold to people you donâ€™t want knowing your
            personal information. Just like how the police cannot search your
            house without a warrant, your data should not be broadcast to the
            world without your permission.
