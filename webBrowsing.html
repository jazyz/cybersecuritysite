          <b>The Issue:</b><br /><br />
          Every single thing you search can be seen by big tech companies that
          provide you their service. This seems a little invasive to your
          privacy, doesn't it? Here are some of the ways they track you.<br /><br />
          <b>1. Search Engines</b><br /><br />Today, people across the world use
          search engines on a regular basis. Modern browsers track tons of stuff
          such as search history, IP addresses, and click through history. This
          information is sold and used for profiling, or making a customer
          persona. It is a serious privacy issue if someone’s profile gets
          associated with their personally identifiable information, because
          data breaches could happen. Also, sometimes, you just don’t want other
          people to see something you search, like "why do I have toe fungus?"
          <br /><br /><b>2. Cookies</b><br /><br />Cookies are simply text files
          that monitor information about your computer and browsing behaviour.
          They can see everything you search and send that information without
          your knowledge to websites. We see the danger that comes with cookies,
          since they may submit sensitive data without explicit permission from
          the user. Right now, there are not sufficient laws in place to prevent
          against the threat of tracking cookies. How many times have you seen a
          website that claims cookies are essential to their function? This is
          an easy way for businesses to circumvent those legal provisions.<br /><br /><br />
          <b>The Solutions:</b><br /><br />
          So how can we protect our privacy when browsing the web? There are a
          variety of ways to do so.<br /><br />
          <b>1. VPN</b><br /><br />In order to minimize the risk of having your
          information collected during web browsing, the best measure you can
          take is using a VPN. This creates a private network from a public
          internet connection. This will give you online privacy and anonymity
          and mask your IP address, so that it is impossible to trace your
          online actions. ExpressVPN is one great option.<br /><br />
          <b>2. Use Different Search Engine</b><br /><br />You can also use a
          different search engine altogether such as DuckDuckGo. The advantage
          of DuckDuckGo is that it doesn't collect your data and track your
          searches. It doesn't associate your IP address with what you search,
          unlike search engines such as Google.<br /><br />
          <b>3. Cookie Blocking</b><br /><br />There are ways to deal with
          annoying cookie trackers. Use cookie blocking extensions such as Ninja
          Cookie, which blocks all non-essential cookies.
